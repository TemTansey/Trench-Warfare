## Description

The project is part of a university module centered around Audio. The idea is to create a basic game with enhanced audio using tools such as Fmod and Reaper. Using Fmods unity implementation as a basis to create events and the like as they are triggered in game. The project gave 3 choices on which game would be getting the audio created for it. The first choice was a pre-made ninja game, the second choice was to use a pre-made students game and finally the last choice was to create your own game. Creating the game was the most favourable style so it was chosen.
